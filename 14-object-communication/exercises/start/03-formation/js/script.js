/*
Generate 150 bubbles with random positions and a size of 10. 

When the user clicks, the bubbles should move towards a line in the middle of the screen. (run solution to see what we mean)
When the user clicks again, the bubbles should move randomly again.

Hint: You can use the lerp() function to move the bubbles towards the mouse position. Check the demos folder for an example.

The code is almost identical to the previous exercise. The only difference is that we are now using a line instead of a point as the target position.
